27;2;13~~27;2;13~~27;2;13~Providers
Using any LLM provider in OpenCode.

OpenCode uses the AI SDK and Models.dev to support 75+ LLM providers and it supports running local models.

To add a provider you need to:

Add the API keys for the provider using the /connect command.
Configure the provider in your OpenCode config.
Credentials
When you add a provider’s API keys with the /connect command, they are stored in ~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json.

Config
You can customize the providers through the provider section in your OpenCode config.

Base URL
You can customize the base URL for any provider by setting the baseURL option. This is useful when using proxy services or custom endpoints.

opencode.json
{
"$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
"provider": {
"anthropic": {
"options": {
"baseURL": "https://api.anthropic.com/v1"
}
}
}
}

Hiding models
You can hide specific models from the /models picker for a provider using the blacklist option. This is useful when a provider exposes models you don’t want to use or select.

opencode.json
{
"$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
"provider": {
"anthropic": {
"blacklist": ["claude-opus-4-20250514"]
}
}
}

The inverse whitelist option hides every model except the ones listed.

opencode.json
{
"$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
"provider": {
"anthropic": {
"whitelist": ["claude-sonnet-4-20250514"]
}
}
}

Both options take an array of model IDs — the same IDs shown in the /models picker.

blacklist removes the listed models from the picker.
whitelist keeps only the listed models and hides the rest.
You can combine them: whitelist narrows the set, then blacklist removes entries from it.
OpenCode Zen

Amazon Bedrock
To use Amazon Bedrock with OpenCode:

Head over to the Model catalog in the Amazon Bedrock console and request access to the models you want.

Tip

You need to have access to the model you want in Amazon Bedrock.

Configure authentication using one of the following methods:

Environment Variables (Quick Start)
Set one of these environment variables while running opencode:

Terminal window

# Option 1: Using AWS access keys

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXX AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YYY opencode

# Option 2: Using named AWS profile

AWS_PROFILE=my-profile opencode

# Option 3: Using Bedrock bearer token

AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK=XXX opencode

Or add them to your bash profile:

~/.bash_profile
export AWS_PROFILE=my-dev-profile
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1

Configuration File (Recommended)
For project-specific or persistent configuration, use opencode.json:

opencode.json
{
"$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
"provider": {
"amazon-bedrock": {
"options": {
"region": "us-east-1",
"profile": "my-aws-profile"
}
}
}
}

Available options:

region - AWS region (e.g., us-east-1, eu-west-1)
profile - AWS named profile from ~/.aws/credentials
endpoint - Custom endpoint URL for VPC endpoints (alias for generic baseURL option)
Tip

Configuration file options take precedence over environment variables.

Advanced: VPC Endpoints
If you’re using VPC endpoints for Bedrock:

opencode.json
{
"$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
"provider": {
"amazon-bedrock": {
"options": {
"region": "us-east-1",
"profile": "production",
"endpoint": "https://bedrock-runtime.us-east-1.vpce-xxxxx.amazonaws.com"
}
}
}
}

Note

The endpoint option is an alias for the generic baseURL option, using AWS-specific terminology. If both endpoint and baseURL are specified, endpoint takes precedence.

Authentication Methods
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID / AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: Create an IAM user and generate access keys in the AWS Console
AWS_PROFILE: Use named profiles from ~/.aws/credentials. First configure with aws configure --profile my-profile or aws sso login
AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK: Generate long-term API keys from the Amazon Bedrock console
AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE / AWS_ROLE_ARN: For EKS IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts) or other Kubernetes environments with OIDC federation. These environment variables are automatically injected by Kubernetes when using service account annotations.
Authentication Precedence
Amazon Bedrock uses the following authentication priority:

Bearer Token - AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK environment variable or token from /connect command
AWS Credential Chain - Profile, access keys, shared credentials, IAM roles, Web Identity Tokens (EKS IRSA), instance metadata
Note

When a bearer token is set (via /connect or AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK), it takes precedence over all AWS credential methods including configured profiles.

Run the /models command to select the model you want.

/models

Note

For custom inference profiles, use the model and provider name in the key and set the id property to the arn. This ensures correct caching.

opencode.json
{
"$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
"provider": {
"amazon-bedrock": {
// ...
"models": {
"anthropic-claude-sonnet-4.5": {
"id": "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1:xxx:application-inference-profile/yyy"
}
}
}
}
}

Anthropic
Once you’ve signed up, run the /connect command and select Anthropic.

/connect

Here you can select the Claude Pro/Max option and it’ll open your browser and ask you to authenticate.

┌ Select auth method
│
│ Manually enter API Key
└

Now all the Anthropic models should be available when you use the /models command.

/models

There are plugins that allow you to use your Claude Pro/Max models with OpenCode. Anthropic explicitly prohibits this.

Previous versions of OpenCode came bundled with these plugins but that is no longer the case as of 1.3.0

Other companies support freedom of choice with developer tooling - you can use the following subscriptions in OpenCode with zero setup:

ChatGPT Plus
Github Copilot
Gitlab Duo
Atomic Chat
You can configure opencode to use local models through Atomic Chat, a desktop application that runs local LLMs behind an OpenAI-compatible API server (default endpoint http://127.0.0.1:1337/v1).

opencode.json
{
"$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
"provider": {
"atomic-chat": {
"npm": "@ai-sdk/openai-compatible",
"name": "Atomic Chat (local)",
"options": {
"baseURL": "http://127.0.0.1:1337/v1"
},
"models": {
"<your-model-id>": {
"name": "<your-model-name>"
}
}
}
}
}

In this example:

atomic-chat is the custom provider ID. This can be any string you want.
npm specifies the package to use for this provider. Here, @ai-sdk/openai-compatible is used for any OpenAI-compatible API.
name is the display name for the provider in the UI.
options.baseURL is the endpoint for the local server. Change the host and port to match your Atomic Chat setup.
models is a map of model IDs to their display names. Each ID must match the id returned by GET /v1/models — run curl http://127.0.0.1:1337/v1/models to list the ids currently loaded in Atomic Chat.
Tip

If tool calls aren’t working well, pick a loaded model with strong tool-calling support (for example, a Qwen-Coder or DeepSeek-Coder variant).

Azure OpenAI
Note

If you encounter “I’m sorry, but I cannot assist with that request” errors, try changing the content filter from DefaultV2 to Default in your Azure resource.

Head over to the Azure portal and create an Azure OpenAI resource. You’ll need:

Resource name: This becomes part of your API endpoint (https://RESOURCE_NAME.openai.azure.com/)

DigitalOcean
DigitalOcean’s Inference Engine provides access to open models like GPT-OSS, Llama, Qwen, and DeepSeek, plus custom Inference Routers that route each request to the cheapest, fastest, or best-fit model for a task.

OpenCode supports two authentication methods:

OAuth (Recommended) — Sign in to your DigitalOcean account; OpenCode uses your DigitalOcean API token directly for inference and discovers your Inference Routers.
Model Access Key — Paste an existing key from the DigitalOcean console.
OAuth (Recommended)
Run the /connect command and search for DigitalOcean.

/connect

Select Login with DigitalOcean.

┌ Select auth method
│
│ Login with DigitalOcean
│ Paste Model Access Key
└

Your browser opens to authorize OpenCode. Sign in and approve.

Note

OpenCode requests genai:read and inference:query OAuth scopes. Your DigitalOcean API token is used directly for inference — no separate Model Access Key is created.

Note

Inference Routers only appear in the model picker after OAuth. Pasting a Model Access Key manually does not discover routers.

Run the /models command. Your Inference Routers appear as the format router: in the model selection.

/models

To pick up newly created Inference Routers, re-run /connect and select DigitalOcean again.

Using a Model Access Key
If you’d rather paste a key directly:

Head over to the Manage page in the Inference section of the DigitalOcean console and create a new key.

Run the /connect command and select DigitalOcean, then Paste Model Access Key.

┌ Enter your DigitalOcean Model Access Key
│
│
└ enter

Note

Inference Routers are not auto-discovered with this method. To surface them in the model picker, sign in via OAuth instead.

Run the /models command to select a model.

/models

Environment Variable
Alternatively, set your Model Access Key as an environment variable.

export DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-model-access-key

Inference Routers
Inference Routers let you define a routing policy across multiple models — picking the cheapest, fastest, or most appropriate model per request based on the task. After OAuth, OpenCode surfaces each router as router:<router-name> in the model picker.

Selecting a router model is a drop-in replacement for any other model — OpenCode forwards your request and DigitalOcean picks the underlying model based on your router’s policy. Learn more about Inference Routers

FrogBot

duo-chat-sonnet-4-5 - Balanced performance for most workflows
duo-chat-opus-4-5 - Most capable for complex analysis
Note

You can also specify ‘GITLAB_TOKEN’ environment variable if you don’t want to store token in opencode auth storage.

Self-Hosted GitLab
compliance note

OpenCode uses a small model for some AI tasks like generating the session title. It is configured to use gpt-5-nano by default, hosted by Zen. To lock OpenCode to only use your own GitLab-hosted instance, add the following to your opencode.json file. It is also recommended to disable session sharing.

{
"$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
"small_model": "gitlab/duo-chat-haiku-4-5",
"share": "disabled"
}

For self-hosted GitLab instances:

Terminal window
export GITLAB_INSTANCE_URL=https://gitlab.company.com
export GITLAB_TOKEN=glpat-...

If your instance runs a custom AI Gateway:

Terminal window
GITLAB_AI_GATEWAY_URL=https://ai-gateway.company.com

Or add to your bash profile:

~/.bash_profile
export GITLAB_INSTANCE_URL=https://gitlab.company.com
export GITLAB_AI_GATEWAY_URL=https://ai-gateway.company.com
export GITLAB_TOKEN=glpat-...

Note

Your GitLab administrator must:

Turn on GitLab Duo for the user, group, or instance
Turn on the Agent Platform (GitLab 18.8+) or enable beta and experimental features (GitLab 18.7 and earlier)
For Self-Managed, configure your instance
OAuth for Self-Hosted instances
In order to make Oauth working for your self-hosted instance, you need to create a new application (Settings → Applications) with the callback URL http://127.0.0.1:8080/callback and following scopes:

api (Access the API on your behalf)
read_user (Read your personal information)
read_repository (Allows read-only access to the repository)
Then expose application ID as environment variable:

Terminal window
export GITLAB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your_application_id_here

More documentation on opencode-gitlab-auth homepage.

Configuration
Customize through opencode.json:

opencode.json
{
"$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
"provider": {
"gitlab": {
"options": {
"instanceUrl": "https://gitlab.com"
}
}
}
}

GitLab Duo Agent Platform (DAP) Workflow Models
DAP workflow models provide an alternative execution path that routes tool calls through GitLab’s Duo Workflow Service (DWS) instead of the standard agentic chat. When a duo-workflow-* model is selected, OpenCode will:

Discover available models from your GitLab namespace
Present a selection picker if multiple models are available
Cache the selected model to disk for fast subsequent startups
Route tool execution requests through OpenCode’s permission-gated tool system
Available DAP workflow models follow the duo-workflow-* naming convention and are dynamically discovered from your GitLab instance.

GitLab API Tools (Optional, but highly recommended)
To access GitLab tools (merge requests, issues, pipelines, CI/CD, etc.):

opencode.json
{
"$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
"plugin": ["opencode-gitlab-plugin"]
}

This plugin provides comprehensive GitLab repository management capabilities including MR reviews, issue tracking, pipeline monitoring, and more.

Optional Configs
In the event you see a feature or model from Helicone that isn’t configured automatically through opencode, you can always configure it yourself.

Here’s Helicone’s Model Directory, you’ll need this to grab the IDs of the models you want to add.

~/.config/opencode/opencode.jsonc
{
"$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
"provider": {
"helicone": {
"npm": "@ai-sdk/openai-compatible",
"name": "Helicone",
"options": {
"baseURL": "https://ai-gateway.helicone.ai",
},
"models": {
"gpt-4o": {
// Model ID (from Helicone's model directory page)
"name": "GPT-4o", // Your own custom name for the model
},
"claude-sonnet-4-20250514": {
"name": "Claude Sonnet 4",
},
},
},
},
}

Custom Headers
Helicone supports custom headers for features like caching, user tracking, and session management. Add them to your provider config using options.headers:

~/.config/opencode/opencode.jsonc
{
"$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
"provider": {
"helicone": {
"npm": "@ai-sdk/openai-compatible",
"name": "Helicone",
"options": {
"baseURL": "https://ai-gateway.helicone.ai",
"headers": {
"Helicone-Cache-Enabled": "true",
"Helicone-User-Id": "opencode",
},
},
},
},
}

Session tracking
Helicone’s Sessions feature lets you group related LLM requests together. Use the opencode-helicone-session plugin to automatically log each OpenCode conversation as a session in Helicone.

Terminal window
npm install -g opencode-helicone-session

Add it to your config.

opencode.json
{
"plugin": ["opencode-helicone-session"]
}

The plugin injects Helicone-Session-Id and Helicone-Session-Name headers into your requests. In Helicone’s Sessions page, you’ll see each OpenCode conversation listed as a separate session.

Common Helicone headers
Header Description
Helicone-Cache-Enabled Enable response caching (true/false)
Helicone-User-Id Track metrics by user
Helicone-Property-[Name] Add custom properties (e.g., Helicone-Property-Environment)
Helicone-Prompt-Id Associate requests with prompt versions
See the Helicone Header Directory for all available headers.

Snowflake Cortex
Snowflake Cortex gives you access to frontier models (Claude, OpenAI GPT-5, and more) via an OpenAI-compatible API. All inference runs within the Snowflake perimeter and is billed in Snowflake credits. For per-model rates, see the Snowflake Service Consumption Table.

Don’t have a Snowflake account? Sign up for a free trial.

opencode’s core workflow for coding, editing files, and running commands relies on tool calling. Only the Claude and OpenAI families within Snowflake Cortex support this. The provider is limited to those families to support the core workflow.

OpenCode supports two authentication methods:

Browser OAuth (Recommended) — sign in with your IdP/SSO; no secrets to manage, tokens refresh automatically.
Manual bearer token — paste a PAT or JWT from the Snowflake console.
Browser OAuth (Recommended)
Run the /connect command and search for Snowflake Cortex.

/connect

Select Login with Snowflake (External Browser).

┌ Select auth method
│
│ Login with Snowflake (External Browser)
│ Paste PAT or bearer token manually
└

Enter your account identifier when prompted, for example myorg-myaccount or xy12345.us-east-1.

┌ Snowflake Account Identifier
│
│
└ enter

Optionally enter a Snowflake role to scope the session (e.g. SYSADMIN). Leave blank to use your default role.

Complete sign-in in the browser that opens. OpenCode captures the OAuth callback automatically and stores the token — no copy/paste needed.

Run the /models command to select a model.

/models

Note

Browser OAuth uses Snowflake’s built-in SNOWFLAKE$LOCAL_APPLICATION security integration (docs), which is rolling out to all accounts. To check availability in your account:

SHOW SECURITY INTEGRATIONS LIKE 'SNOWFLAKE$LOCAL_APPLICATION';

If the result is empty, use the Manual bearer token method below while the integration rolls out to your account.

Manual bearer token
If you prefer to paste a token directly, or if SNOWFLAKE$LOCAL_APPLICATION is not yet available in your account:

Generate a Programmatic Access Token (PAT) in your Snowflake account.

Run the /connect command, search for Snowflake Cortex, and select Paste PAT or bearer token manually.

Enter your account identifier when prompted.

Paste your PAT.

Run the /models command to select a model.

/models

Environment variable
For CI or headless environments, set a PAT or JWT before starting opencode:

Terminal window
export SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT=myorg-myaccount
export SNOWFLAKE_CORTEX_TOKEN=your-pat-or-jwt

Note

SNOWFLAKE_CORTEX_TOKEN accepts a PAT or JWT only — the browser OAuth flow is available via /connect only and cannot be configured through an environment variable. SNOWFLAKE_CORTEX_PAT is still supported for backward compatibility.

The model catalog is provided automatically. A minimal opencode.json is all that’s needed:

opencode.json
{
"$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
"model": "snowflake-cortex/claude-sonnet-4-6",
"small_model": "snowflake-cortex/claude-haiku-4-5"

"vercel": {
"models": {
"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4": {
"options": {
"order": ["anthropic", "vertex"]
}
}
}
}
}
}

Some useful routing options:

Option Description
order Provider sequence to try
only Restrict to specific providers
zeroDataRetention Only use providers with zero data retention policies
xAI
Two ways to authenticate: a SuperGrok subscription via device-code OAuth or a pay-as-you-go API key from the xAI console.

Option A — SuperGrok subscription
Run the /connect command and search for xAI.

/connect

Select SuperGrok Subscription. OpenCode opens xAI’s verification link with the user code pre-populated when supported.

Approve the consent screen. If xAI asks for a code, enter the user code displayed by OpenCode. OpenCode polls xAI’s token endpoint and stores the resulting OAuth tokens once you approve.

Run the /models command to select a Grok model.

/models

OpenCode refreshes the OAuth access token automatically. Any Grok or X Premium plan that includes Grok API access works; you do not need a separate XAI_API_KEY.

Option B — API key

}

Custom provider
To add any OpenAI-compatible provider that’s not listed in the /connect command:

Tip

You can use any OpenAI-compatible provider with opencode. Most modern AI providers offer OpenAI-compatible APIs.

Run the /connect command and scroll down to Other.

Terminal window
$ /connect

┌ Add credential
│
◆ Select provider
│ ...
│ ● Other
└

Enter a unique ID for the provider.

Terminal window
$ /connect

┌ Add credential
│
◇ Enter provider id

Note

Choose a memorable ID, you’ll use this in your config file.

Enter your API key for the provider.

Terminal window
$ /connect

┌ Add credential
│
▲ This only stores a credential for myprovider - you will need to configure it in opencode.json, check the docs for examples.
│
◇ Enter your API key
│ sk-...
└

Create or update your opencode.json file in your project directory:

opencode.json
{
"$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
"provider": {
"myprovider": {
"npm": "@ai-sdk/openai-compatible",
"name": "My AI ProviderDisplay Name",
"options": {
"baseURL": "https://api.myprovider.com/v1"
},
"models": {
"my-model-name": {
"name": "My Model Display Name"
}
}
}
}
}

Here are the configuration options:

npm: AI SDK package to use, @ai-sdk/openai-compatible for OpenAI-compatible providers (for /v1/chat/completions). If your provider/model uses /v1/responses, use @ai-sdk/openai.
name: Display name in UI.
models: Available models.
options.baseURL: API endpoint URL.
options.apiKey: Optionally set the API key, if not using auth.
options.headers: Optionally set custom headers.
More on the advanced options in the example below.

Run the /models command and your custom provider and models will appear in the selection list.

Example
Here’s an example setting the apiKey, headers, and model limit options.

opencode.json
{
"$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
"provider": {
"myprovider": {
"npm": "@ai-sdk/openai-compatible",
"name": "My AI ProviderDisplay Name",
"options": {
"baseURL": "https://api.myprovider.com/v1",
"apiKey": "{env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}",
"headers": {
"Authorization": "Bearer custom-token"
}
},
"models": {
"my-model-name": {
"name": "My Model Display Name",
"limit": {
"context": 200000,
"output": 65536
}
}
}
}
}
}

Configuration details:

apiKey: Set using env variable syntax, learn more.
headers: Custom headers sent with each request.
limit.context: Maximum input tokens the model accepts.
limit.output: Maximum tokens the model can generate.
The limit fields allow OpenCode to understand how much context you have left. Standard providers pull these from models.dev automatically.

Troubleshooting
If you are having trouble with configuring a provider, check the following:

Check the auth setup: Run opencode auth list to see if the credentials for the provider are added to your config.

This doesn’t apply to providers like Amazon Bedrock, that rely on environment variables for their auth.

For custom providers, check the opencode config and:

Make sure the provider ID used in the /connect command matches the ID in your opencode config.
The right npm package is used for the provider. For example, use @ai-sdk/cerebras for Cerebras. And for all other OpenAI-compatible providers, use @ai-sdk/openai-compatible (for /v1/chat/completions); if a model uses /v1/responses, use @ai-sdk/openai. For mixed setups under one provider, you can override per model via provider.npm.
Check correct API endpoint is used in the options.baseURL field.

SDK
Type-safe JS client for opencode server.

The opencode JS/TS SDK provides a type-safe client for interacting with the server. Use it to build integrations and control opencode programmatically.

Learn more about how the server works. For examples, check out the projects built by the community.

Install
Install the SDK from npm:

Terminal window
npm install @opencode-ai/sdk

Create client
Create an instance of opencode:

import { createOpencode } from "@opencode-ai/sdk"

const { client } = await createOpencode()

This starts both a server and a client

Options
Option Type Description Default
hostname string Server hostname 127.0.0.1
port number Server port 4096
signal AbortSignal Abort signal for cancellation undefined
timeout number Timeout in ms for server start 5000
config Config Configuration object {}
Config
You can pass a configuration object to customize behavior. The instance still picks up your opencode.json, but you can override or add configuration inline:

import { createOpencode } from "@opencode-ai/sdk"

const opencode = await createOpencode({
hostname: "127.0.0.1",
port: 4096,
config: {
model: "anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
},
})

console.log(`Server running at ${opencode.server.url}`)

opencode.server.close()

Client only
If you already have a running instance of opencode, you can create a client instance to connect to it:

import { createOpencodeClient } from "@opencode-ai/sdk"

const client = createOpencodeClient({
baseUrl: "http://localhost:4096",
})

Options
Option Type Description Default
baseUrl string URL of the server http://localhost:4096
fetch function Custom fetch implementation globalThis.fetch
parseAs string Response parsing method auto
responseStyle string Return style: data or fields fields
throwOnError boolean Throw errors instead of return false
Types
The SDK includes TypeScript definitions for all API types. Import them directly:

import type { Session, Message, Part } from "@opencode-ai/sdk"

All types are generated from the server’s OpenAPI specification and available in the types file.

Errors
The SDK can throw errors that you can catch and handle:

try {
await client.session.get({ path: { id: "invalid-id" } })
} catch (error) {
console.error("Failed to get session:", (error as Error).message)
}

Structured Output
You can request structured JSON output from the model by specifying an format with a JSON schema. The model will use a StructuredOutput tool to return validated JSON matching your schema.

Basic Usage
const result = await client.session.prompt({
path: { id: sessionId },
body: {
parts: [{ type: "text", text: "Research Anthropic and provide company info" }],
format: {
type: "json_schema",
schema: {
type: "object",
properties: {
company: { type: "string", description: "Company name" },
founded: { type: "number", description: "Year founded" },
products: {
type: "array",
items: { type: "string" },
description: "Main products",
},
},
required: ["company", "founded"],
},
},
},
})

// Access the structured output
console.log(result.data.info.structured_output)
// { company: "Anthropic", founded: 2021, products: ["Claude", "Claude API"] }

Output Format Types
Type Description
text Default. Standard text response (no structured output)
json_schema Returns validated JSON matching the provided schema
JSON Schema Format
When using type: 'json_schema', provide:

Field Type Description
type 'json_schema' Required. Specifies JSON schema mode
schema object Required. JSON Schema object defining the output structure
retryCount number Optional. Number of validation retries (default: 2)
Error Handling
If the model fails to produce valid structured output after all retries, the response will include a StructuredOutputError:

if (result.data.info.error?.name === "StructuredOutputError") {
console.error("Failed to produce structured output:", result.data.info.error.message)
console.error("Attempts:", result.data.info.error.retries)
}

Best Practices
Provide clear descriptions in your schema properties to help the model understand what data to extract
Use required to specify which fields must be present
Keep schemas focused - complex nested schemas may be harder for the model to fill correctly
Set appropriate retryCount - increase for complex schemas, decrease for simple ones
APIs
The SDK exposes all server APIs through a type-safe client.

# Using Kilo for Free

Kilo Code can be used completely free of charge. There are three places where Kilo uses AI model inference, and each can be configured to use free models.

## Where Kilo Uses Models

1. **Agentic interactions** — Conversations with coding agents in IDE extensions (VS Code, JetBrains), CLI, and cloud services like App Builder and Code Reviewer
2. **Autocomplete** — In-editor code completions as you type (IDE extensions only)
3. **Background tasks** — Automatic session titles and context summarization

Each of these consumes credits by default. **To use Kilo entirely for free, configure all three to use free models.**

## Free Agentic Usage

Kilo provides free models for coding tasks through the Kilo Gateway and partner providers.

### Auto Free

The easiest way to get started is [**Auto Free**](/docs/code-with-ai/agents/auto-model) (`kilo-auto/free`). This is a Kilo-provided model tier that automatically routes your requests to the best available free models — no configuration needed.

{% callout type="warning" title="Data handling for Auto Free" %}
Auto Free may route your requests to providers that log prompts and outputs and use them to improve their services. Do not submit personal or confidential data when using Auto Free. In particular, it may route to NVIDIA's free endpoints.

For NVIDIA free endpoints (Super/Ultra/etc): Trial use only - do not submit personal or confidential data. Your use is logged for security purposes and to improve NVIDIA products and services. The logged session data for improvement purposes is not linked to your identity or any persistent identifier. For more information about our data processing practices, see our [Privacy Policy](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/about-nvidia/privacy-policy/). By interacting with this endpoint, you consent to our collection, recording, and use of such information and the [NVIDIA API Trial Terms of Service](https://assets.ngc.nvidia.com/products/api-catalog/legal/NVIDIA%20API%20Trial%20Terms%20of%20Service.pdf).
{% /callout %}

### Finding Other Free Models

You can also browse and select individual free models. In the model picker, type `free` to filter the list — free models are clearly labeled across all platforms.

**In the IDE Extensions (VS Code, JetBrains):**

1. Click on the current model below the chat window
2. Type `free` in the search box
3. Select any model labeled "(free)"

**In the CLI:**

1. Run `kilo` to open the CLI
2. Use the `/models` command
3. Type `free` to filter the list

{% callout type="note" %}
Some free models may be rate limited by the upstream provider. If you hit a rate limit, try switching to a different free model.
{% /callout %}

### Cloud Tasks

Kilo's cloud services — App Builder, Code Reviewer, and others — also support free models. Select any model labeled "(free)" in the model dropdown when configuring a cloud task.

{% callout type="tip" %}
Available free models change over time as Kilo partners with different inference providers. Subscribe to our blog or join our [Discord](https://kilo.ai/discord) for updates.
{% /callout %}

## Free Autocomplete

Kilo's autocomplete feature provides AI-powered code completions as you type in IDE extensions.

By default, autocomplete routes through the Kilo provider and uses credits. If you run out of credits without a free alternative configured, autocomplete stops working — but your main coding workflow is unaffected.

### How to Get It Free

Add your own Mistral AI API key via **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)** on the Kilo Gateway. Mistral offers a free tier for Codestral. When you configure a BYOK key, autocomplete requests use your key directly — at no cost on your Kilo balance.

See the [Mistral Setup Guide](/docs/code-with-ai/features/autocomplete/mistral-setup) for step-by-step instructions.

## Free Background Tasks

Kilo uses a small model in the background for tasks like session titling. By default this is Auto Small, which consumes credits. If the small model is unavailable, Kilo falls back to your primary model — which may also consume credits if it's a paid model.

To avoid credit usage for background tasks, set the small model to a free model:

**In the VS Code extension:** Go to **Settings → Models** and change the small model to any free model.

**In the CLI:** Set the `small_model` parameter in `~/.config/kilo/config.json`:

```json
{
  "small_model": "your-preferred-free-model"
}
```

Replace `your-preferred-free-model` with any free model from the model picker.
